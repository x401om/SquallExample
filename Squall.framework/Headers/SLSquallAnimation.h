 SLSquallAnimation is backed by a CADisplayLink and updates the animation whenever
 the display refreshes.
 
 This type of animation will be the most faithful to what you are seeing in After Effects.
 
 All of the updates occur on the main thread. SLSquallAnimations are therefore more susceptible
 to stalls from heavy CPU load than <SLCoreAnimation>.

 This method allows you to have an existing layer in your app inherit the 2D (!) transform
 transformations (position, scale, rotation, anchor point) from a layer in your AE
 animation.
 It works exactly like the parenting behavior in After Effects.
 Place your app layer wherever you need it, add it to the layer hierarchy and then call this method to tie it to a specific AE layer. The app layer will now behave as if glued to this AE layer.
 @warning Do not modify the transform property on the app layer while the parent-child relationship.
 @warning Does not honor 3D transformations.
